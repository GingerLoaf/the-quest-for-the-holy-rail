# Git LFS configuration for Unity projects
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file tells Git which file patterns should be stored in LFS (Large File Storage).
# Rule of thumb:
#   - Put large/binary assets in LFS (models, textures, audio, video, binaries).
#   - Do NOT put Unity .meta files in LFS (keep them in normal Git).
#   - Avoid putting potentially-mergeable Unity YAML/text assets in LFS unless you
#     intentionally want "last writer wins" behavior.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Things you generally should NOT put in LFS:
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Unity metadata must stay in normal Git.
# (No rule needed—just don't add *.meta to LFS.)

# Unity scene/prefab/asset files are often YAML-text (if Force Text is enabled).
# Keeping them in normal Git makes diffs/merges possible.
# If your team prefers locking/last-writer-wins for these, you *can* LFS them,
# but it's usually a bad idea with 10 people during a jam.
# Examples (intentionally NOT in LFS):
#   *.unity
#   *.prefab
#   *.asset
#   *.anim
#   *.controller
